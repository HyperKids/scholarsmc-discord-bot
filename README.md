# ScholarsMC Discord bot
This is a private bot for [ScholarsMC](https://discord.scholarsmc.org). Most of this bot is hardcoded, feel free to @ me on our Discord before adapting this code for your server.
I forked this code from my other repository HyperKids/best-discord-bot - look there for the full codebase.
